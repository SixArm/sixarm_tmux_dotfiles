# The tmux server, and its children, automatically and uncontrollably
# lose access to what would have been their original bootstrap namespace,
# i.e. the one that has access to the pasteboard service.

# wrapper program, which enables us to launch a process and have that process
# be attached to the per-user bootstrap namespace, to make the program behave.
